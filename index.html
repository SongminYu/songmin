            <p>I am a Senior Researcher at the Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research (ISI), having
                obtained my Ph.D. from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2018. My research focuses on energy and
                climate policy modeling, particularly in the building sector and agent-based approaches.
                I contribute to EU Horizon projects like
                <a href="https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/893311" target="_blank">newTRENDs</a> and
                <a href="https://www.ecemf.eu/" target="_blank">ECEMF</a>,
                as well as German policy consultancy work such as

                            <p>Translating global climate targets into national decarbonization roadmaps is profoundly
                                uncertain. To navigate this uncertainty for China, we employ a national-scale energy
                                system model developed in the MESSAGEix framework-calibrated to China's energy
                                balances-that uniquely combines provincial-level resolution for key sectors with a
                                high-granularity representation of intra-annual (48 time slices) power system dynamics.
                                Across three temperature targets (1.5, 1.6, 2.0°C) and six allocation principles, our
                                analysis reveals that wind and solar consistently emerge as "no-regret" pillars, CCS is
                                essential for heavy-industry abatement, and hydrogen's sourcing shifts with budget
                                stringency. A critical systemic co-dependency exists across scenarios with stringent
                                emissions constraints: the power sector must transform into a net carbon sink to enable
                                the decarbonization of heavy industry, creating stark path dependencies across
                                technology choices. The 1.6°C pathway under the Grandfathering principle aligns with
                                China's 2060 neutrality pledge and offers a detailed blueprint for this transition. Our
                                provincial-level analysis distinguishes high-stakes decisions from robust "no-regret"
                                investments, offering a framework to guide China's journey to carbon neutrality.</p>

                            <p>The building sector is pivotal for achieving climate neutrality, requiring sophisticated
                                modeling tools to guide the energy transition. It is highly heterogeneous with variety
                                in both the built environment and in its decision-makers. While many sectoral models
                                exist, most of them fall short of capturing the barriers and limitations in the energy
                                transition as they lack high spatial resolution and a detailed representation of
                                heterogeneous building characteristics and local infrastructure constraints. To address
                                this gap, we present RENDER-Building, a new agent-based model (ABM) designed for
                                high-resolution analysis of building stock transformation. We validate and apply the
                                model to the German building stock to simulate potential transformation pathways until
                                2050 under three distinct scenarios. The individual buildings are the agents here with
                                detailed attributes, located in a settlement type in a NUTS3 region. The model
                                explicitly considers the availability of energy infrastructure and simulates agents’
                                decisions about renovation and technology adoption based on bounded rationality. Our
                                case study’s results indicate that even with ambitious measures, Germany’s building
                                sector may miss its short-term emission targets due to the inertia of the existing
                                stock. A transformation pathway considering realistic challenges could substantially
                                exceed the short- and long-term emission targets, necessitating difficult and
                                potentially costly interventions to get back on track. Our study demonstrates the
                                utility of high-resolution ABMs in providing nuanced, actionable insights for
                                policymakers, helping them to navigate the complexities of the building sector’s energy
                                transition.</p>

                            <p>Technological advancements and behavior shifts are reshaping households’ energy
                                consumption patterns, necessitating advanced models to quantify their behavior, energy
                                system operation, and interactions in the energy communities. While various models
                                address these aspects individually, there is a lack of a unified framework that covers
                                them holistically. This paper presents FLEX, a modeling framework consisting three
                                interconnected components that are designed to feed the output of one into the next.
                                First is FLEX-Behavior, which simulates hourly household energy demands using a Markov
                                core. Second is FLEX-Operation, which models hourly operation of household energy
                                systems across three modes: simulation, perfect-forecasting optimization, and
                                rolling-horizon optimization. Its results are validated with detailed physics-based
                                building simulation software. Third is FLEX-Community, which models the peer-to-peer
                                electricity trading among community members and battery operation of the aggregator.
                                Finally, demonstration results are provided to show the capabilities of FLEX in
                                potential applications for supporting policy design. In summary, FLEX advances existing
                                approaches by bridging detailed household-level behavior and energy system modeling with
                                community-scale optimization, addressing the trade-off between computational
                                tractability and household-level accuracy in the modeling of aggregator-operated energy
                                communities. However, limitations also lie in the requirement of high-quality
                                micro-level data for robust estimation and validation. Future research could investigate
                                system-level dynamics between energy communities and power systems, including
                                participation in ancillary services markets and the evolving regulatory frameworks
                                governing community operations.</p>

                            <p>The electrification of households’ heating systems will lead to an increase in the
                                electricity demand, which will necessitate additional investments in the grid
                                infrastructure. The interaction with other technologies, including PV, batteries,
                                electric vehicles (EVs), and home energy management systems (HEMSs), further complicate
                                the situation. In this study, we analyze the following question: How will prosumaging
                                households, who consume, produce and manage their energy consumption with HEMS, impact
                                the future reinforcement costs of the electricity distribution grid? We conducted case
                                studies for two urban areas, Murcia in Spain and Leeuwarden in The Netherlands. First,
                                by developing scenarios on the uptake of electrified heating systems, PV installations,
                                battery storage, EVs and HEMSs, the energy demand of each building is modeled for the
                                two areas under different scenarios. Then, the buildings’ electricity load profiles were
                                provided to a second model, to calculate the necessary distribution grid infrastructure
                                to cover this demand on a granular spatial level. Results show that low voltage lines
                                and transformers will need significant investments, especially in the regions where a
                                high share of conventional heating systems are replaced by heat pumps but also in
                                regions where the aggregate electricity peak demand is reduced.</p>

                            <p>Agent-based models (ABMs) characterize physical, biological, and social economic systems
                                as dynamic interactions among agents from a bottom-up perspective. The agents can be
                                molecules, animals, or human beings. The interactions can be water molecules forming a
                                vortex, ants searching for food, or people trading stocks in the market. Agents’
                                interactions can bring emergent properties to a system and turn it into a complex
                                system. The core reason for using ABMs is usually to model such mechanisms. Besides,
                                taking social economic systems as example, ABMs are also flexible to consider agents’
                                (1) heterogeneity (e.g., wealth, risk attitude, preference, decision-making rule, etc.)
                                based on micro-data; and (2) bounded rationality and adaptation behavior based on
                                psychological and behavioral studies. Melodie is a general framework for developing
                                agent-based models (ABMs) in Python. It is published and maintained on the GitHub
                                organization page of ABM4ALL, a developing community among agent-based modelers for
                                sharing ideas and resources. Together with the code repository, we have also published
                                the documentation of Melodie, including a tutorial explaining how a minimum example - an
                                agent-based covid contagion model - can be developed with Melodie step by step.</p>

                            <p>This article proposes an agent-based policy simulation framework that can be applied to
                                the cases satisfying: 1) the agents try to maximize some intertemporal preference and 2)
                                the impacts of different factors on agents’ behavioral tendency are monotonic. By
                                combining the simulation and optimization methods, this framework balances the
                                flexibility and validity of agent-based models (ABMs): the sigmoid function is modified
                                and used to model agents’ decision-making rules, and the evolutionary training method is
                                used to calibrate agents’ behavioral parameters. Based on an example for the emission
                                trading scheme, the application of the framework is presented and evaluated in detail.

                            <p>Though sharing a similar practice form, the emission trading scheme is distinguished from
                                traditional financial markets: firms coordinate three abatement options at the micro
                                level, including allowance trading, output adjustment, and low-carbon technology
                                adoption. Then, at the macro level, this leads to dynamic interactions among allowance
                                market, output market, and low-carbon technology diffusion. This is the fundamental
                                characteristic of the emission trading scheme, and modeling the dynamics behind is a
                                major difficulty for relevant studies, especially when following complexities are
                                considered: (1) different planning horizons of the three abatement options, (2)
                                heterogeneity among sectors and firms, and (3) details of firms’ production and optional
                                low-carbon technologies. Aiming at this difficulty, we establish an agent-based model
                                for the emission trading scheme, and within a novel multi-level time frame, the
                                fundamental characteristic is reflected and the complexities are considered. Firms’
                                production and low-carbon technologies are discretely modeled at a process level from a
                                bottom-up perspective, and based on European data, our model is calibrated to cover 5
                                industrial sectors, 11 emission-intensive products, 25 production processes, and 52
                                low-carbon technologies. With this model, the emergence properties and uncertainty of
                                the system are captured, and the non-linear impact of the abatement target is reflected
                                and discussed. We find that, after a certain level, higher target leads to lower
                                allowance price uncertainty but stronger output impact, which is a trade-off for setting
                                the abatement target.</p>
